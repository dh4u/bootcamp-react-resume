In that moment Jimmy Page cemented his legacy and altered the course of popular music with a single guitar: his Fender Telecaster. </p><p>The Fender Jimmy Page Telecaster is an homage to that guitar, which began life in its factory White Blonde lacquer finish, then became the "mirror guitar" before taking on its final form – a magical one-of-a-kind instrument, hand-painted by Page himself, that would go on to produce some of the most iconic riffs of the 20th Century.</p><p>When Led Zeppelin was formed in October 1968, the Telecaster became Page’s go-to instrument and he played it on stage and in the studio until 1969. It was also the main guitar used on the legendary Led Zeppelin I album. Page went on tour in 1969, and upon his return, he discovered a friend had kindly stripped the body and painted over the dragon paint job. The paint job compromised the sound and wiring, leaving only the neck pickup working. He salvaged the neck and put it on his brown string bender Tele, and has since re-stripped and restored the body in full.</p><p>"This guitar is so special and has so much history, so I approached Fender to see if they’d be interested in recreating it," Page said. "They really got it 110 percent right, or 150 percent right. It\'s so absolutely as it is, as it should be, and as it was."</p><h6>Features</h6> <ul> <li>Satin lacquer finish over a reproduction of Jimmy Page’s iconic artwork</li><li>Two custom-wound Jimmy Page Telecaster single-coil pickups</li><li>Custom "Thin D"-shaped maple neck; 7.25"-radius slab rosewood fingerboard</li><li>Top-loader bridge with threaded steel saddles</li><li>Includes vintage-style black hardshell case</li></ul>';

        description = '<p>When Fender created this limited-edition American Elite Stratocaster, their goal was to make a nearly irresistible instrument.  By taking the classic visual style that\'s kept the Strat at the forefront of electric guitars for over 60 years, and combining it with a modern feature set, they\'ve succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. </p><h6>A thing of beauty</h6> <p>Starting with an almost three-dimensional translucent finish on a gorgeous quilted maple top, it could win on looks alone. The top and the subtle burst finish accentuate the traditional Strat body curves, setting this guitar apart from the crowd. The maple also carries subtle tonal effects, adding an overlay of brightness and sustain to the solid alder body. Some players also feel that maple adds some extra liveliness to the guitar\'s response. While that\'s an individual opinion, you will want to simply pick this guitar up and play, because it just looks so good.</p><p>Playability gains an added boost from the maple on maple neck. While many modern guitars boast a compound-radius fingerboard, the American Elite Strat goes one further with a compound-profile neck for added comfort and ease of playing. Combining a 9.5" radius and a modern-"C" profile at the nut, it smoothly moves to a "D" profile and a 14" radius by the time it reaches the updated, contoured neck heel.</p><h6>Sophisticated design and the latest electronics</h6> <p>Locking short-post tuners ensure proper break angle over the synthetic bone nut, delivering buzz-free playing performance and stable tuning, no matter how hard you work the two-point fulcrum tremolo. So whammy away, as subtly or as overtly as you need, because this guitar has you covered.</p><p>The electronics package is an extra-special feature. With the latest 4th Generation Noiseless pickups in the neck and middle and an open-coil Shawbucker in the bridge, the American Elite Strat can easily go from a subtle, intimate vintage-voiced whisper to a full-throated scream. When you need that extra little bit of totally over-the-top tonal boost, a push-push knob switch moves you into what Fender calls the "Passing Lane," where the bridge pickup bypasses the tone circuit and its full signal is sent directly to the output jack. This provides enhanced overtones, extra output and a new surge of adrenaline.</p><p>The entire package is designed precisely for the modern player who desires tonal versatility and exceptional performance and playability. Every time you plug this guitar in, you\'ll discover something new, and it\'s so comfortable and easy to play, you\'ll just keep picking it up again and again. The American Elite Strat HSS with quilt-maple top includes a premium hardshell case.</p><div> <h6>Features</h6> <ul> <li>Alder body with quilted maple top</li><li>Bolt-on maple neck with maple fingerboard and compound neck profile</li><li>Shawbucker and 4th generation noiseless Strat pickups</li><li>2-Point American Deluxe synchronized tremolo and locking tuners</li></ul> </div>';

        description = '<p>Fender\'s Jimmy Page Mirror Telecaster is a recreation of a guitar that was at the heart of multiple historic rock-and-roll moments. It has been in the hands of two of the most iconic guitarists in the musical (r)evolution of the 1960s. The original 1959 Telecaster\'s first owner was Jeff Beck, who gifted it to Jimmy Page in 1966, as a thank you for recommending him to the Yardbirds when Page couldn\'t take the gig. Page then briefly joined the band and played the guitar with them (he can be seen with it in the nightclub scene in Michelangelo Antonioni\'s 1966 film Blow Up) and it is one of the primary guitars used in the creation of the first Led Zeppelin album. Now, Fender has created this tribute to the guitar that arguably changed the course of music.</p><h6>Building on a solid platform</h6> <p>This unique guitar starts with a recreation of the \'59 White Blonde, top-loading Telecaster. This was the guitar\'s appearance until early 1967, when Page added eight round mirrors to the body. While Fender didn\'t attach mirrors to the tribute guitar, to avoid them being damaged in shipping and display, eight are included with the guitar for you to attach if you want.</p><h6>Crafting the tone</h6> <p>It\'s then loaded with a pair of Jimmy Page Custom \'59 Tele pickups, wound to deliver the tone that created the incendiary riffage of the first Zeppelin album. The guitar also comes with the top-loading bridge that was standard on 1959, and some 1960, Telecasters. While it can also be strung in the standard string-thru-body manner, the top-loading bridge offers a couple of advantages. Because it reduces total string length, it reduces string tension, which produces a tone that\'s both warmer and "zingier" (for lack of a better term). These tonal qualities are evident in the original\'s appearance in Page\'s much-admired solo on "Stairway to Heaven"</p><h6>Designed with the artist</h6> <p>Page himself was heavily involved in the creation of this tribute to the instrument he refers to as "quite a magical guitar," and his signature appears both on the back of the headstock and the custom neck plate. The complete Jimmy Page Mirror Telecaster package also includes a vintage-style hard case, "stained-glass" strap, classic black coil guitar cable and a custom Certificate of Authenticity. </p><h6>Own the magic</h6> <p>Whether you\'re a rabid fan of Page\'s career and playing, or simply appreciate an extraordinary instrument, the Fender Jimmy Page Mirror Telecaster is a very special Tele, indeed. With great tone, extraordinary playability and a pedigree that includes two of the world\'s greatest rock guitarists, it\'s one that you\'ll be proud to have as part of your collection.</p><h6>Features</h6> <ul> <li>Gloss-finish 2-piece solid ash body</li>25.5"-scale maple neck with 21-fret rosewood fingerboard <li>Dual custom-wound Jimmy Page \'59 Tele pickups, 3-way switch</li><li>Vintage-style "top-loader" bridge with 3 steel barrels, Pure Vintage tuners</li></ul>';
