		"description": "I have over 15 years of experience with web development technologies such as JavaScript, Adobe ColdFusion, MS SQL Server, Oracle, HTML, and CSS. I am looking to apply these skills in a Full Stack Developer position working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I have been learning this stack over the last six months and will complete the Full Stack Developer boot camp at <a href='https://www.hyperiondev.com' target='_blank'><span style='font-weight: bold'>Hyperion Dev</span></a> in September 2019.",

		"bio": "<p>I'm dry-humored and the most socialable introvert you will meet. For example, my partner and I have been to over 25 weddings together, and I've dragged her to the majority of them. I enjoy traveling and still find it amazing that I have been fortunate enough to travel to about 30 countries on 6 continents, most recently Nepal and Indonesia.</p><p>As a software engineer, I enjoy developing with ColdFusion, and I think it is a shame that Adobe hasn't done more to boost its profile. That said, I learned <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> while developing ColdFusion applications, and I would now like to use these and other skills while working with modern technologies.</p><p>Currently, I am attending a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> bootcamp using the <strong>MERN</strong> stack. It is nice to have more tools in my toolbox, and I'm looking forward to new opportunities to use them. While my bootcamp projects cover the full MERN stack, I have most enjoyed learning backend <strong>API development</strong> using <strong>Express.js</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>. Additionally, I have appreciated the chance to update my front end development skills, adding <strong>Bootstrap and responsive CSS</strong> to my repertoire.</p><p>Professionally, I value a sense of ownership most of all. The position that I recall most fondly was at CLR where I built an intranet from the ground up. I was responsible for all aspects of the project — managing web hosting including database and web server setup, database architecture / design, and software development. As I automated CLR's processes, I felt great pride in developing software that fostered communication between employees and made work easier for them.</p><p>I enjoy a challenge and I believe that if you aren't in a little over your head, you will not grow. I'm looking for my next challenge.</p>",
