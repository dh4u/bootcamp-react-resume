		"bio": "<p>Outside of work I value spending time with friends, cooking, and traveling with my partner. I feel very fortunate to have traveled to about 30 countries on 6 continents! <br /><p>Professionally, I value a sense of ownership and working on projects that make a difference. The position that I recall most fondly was at CLR where I built an intranet from the ground up, automating many time-consuming processes. I felt great pride each time a coworker told me how much time and work these automations saved them. And, like a lot of developers, I also appreciate times when I can put my head down and write code.</p><p>Technology changes rapidly, so I strive to keep learning. In early 2020, I completed a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> certification using the <strong>MERN</strong> stack to update my skills and stay competitive. In the bootcamp, I most enjoyed developing <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> using <strong>Node.js, Express,</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong> and  strengthening my front end development skills by adding <strong>React, Bootstrap,</strong> and <strong>responsive CSS</strong> to my repertoire. I've also recently learned <strong>Ruby,</strong> <strong>Jekyll,</strong> <strong>Liquid Templates,</strong> and the <a href='https://designsystem.digital.gov/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>US Web Design System</strong></a>.</p><p>I am actively looking for a full time position where I can keep learning and dedicate my time to an organization I care about. I’m currently freelancing on various projects using NextJS, VueJS, MS SQL, HTML, and CSS.</p>",
